              I teach sciences across KS2–KS5 with experience at The Vale School
              Muthaiga, St. Christopher&apos;s International (Deputy Head –
              Pastoral), and Kenton College Prep. My passion for education
              extends beyond traditional classroom boundaries, focusing on
              innovative teaching methodologies and holistic student
              development. As a professional athlete and coach, I&apos;ve had the
              privilege of leading multiple Kenya U‑20 squads at the Junior
              World Rugby Trophy. This experience has profoundly shaped my
              understanding of leadership, teamwork, and the transformative
              power of sport in youth development. My commitment to empowering
              underprivileged youth led me to found King&apos;s Rugby Academy
              (Kibera), South Coast Pirates Academy, and Phoenix Sports Africa—a
              comprehensive multi-sport academy. I also commissioned
              PhoenixPlay, an innovative tech platform for managing academies,
              coaches, and players, bridging the gap between traditional sports
              development and cutting-edge technology.
